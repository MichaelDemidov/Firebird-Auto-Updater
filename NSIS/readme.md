# Firebird NSIS script
The only purpose of this script is to allow the user to download and run a single exe file without having to deal with unzipping all the necessary files.

Please copy the executable file and the desired configuration file in the `Firebird` folder. Then rename the config file to `fbupdate.cfg`. Also copy the Firebird setup file in the `Firebird\update` folder.

Then compile then `Firebird.nsi` script.
